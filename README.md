# Trading the electricity market
This is my response to a challenge. The challenge is to come up with some data analysis or modelling that might be of interest to someone trying to trade the electricity market. 

My idea: building a trading-bot that automatically trades the electricity market.

# Data
I was given a datasets that I cannot share. It includes basic trading information like, price, timestamps, product identifiers and delivery information.

# Installation
Install the following packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, jupyter, pytorch, random, time

# Run the trading-bot
To run the trading bot, import trading_bot from trading_bot.py and run it with the required input.
